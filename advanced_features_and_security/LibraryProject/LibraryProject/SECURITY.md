Security Measures Implemented in LibraryProject
This document outlines the security best practices implemented in the LibraryProject Django application.

1. Secure Django Settings
We have configured Django settings to prevent common security vulnerabilities:

üîí Debug Mode Disabled
DEBUG = False in production to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
üõ° Browser-Side Security Protections
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True: Prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY': Prevents clickjacking by denying iframe embedding.
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True: Prevents browsers from guessing the content type to avoid MIME-type sniffing attacks.
üîê Secure Cookies (HTTPS-Only)
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True: Ensures CSRF tokens are sent only over HTTPS.
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True: Ensures session cookies are sent only over HTTPS.
2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
All form-based POST requests include CSRF protection using Django‚Äôs {% csrf_token %} tag.
‚úÖ Checked and confirmed in all form templates.

Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <input type="text" name="title">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
3. SQL Injection Prevention
To prevent SQL injection, we use Django's ORM instead of raw SQL queries.

‚úÖ Before (Vulnerable Code):

python
Copy
Edit
query = "SELECT * FROM bookshelf_book WHERE title = '%s'" % user_input
books = Book.objects.raw(query)  # ‚ùå Dangerous!
‚úÖ After (Secure ORM Query):

python
Copy
Edit
books = Book.objects.filter(title=user_input)  # ‚úÖ Secure!
4. Content Security Policy (CSP)
CSP prevents malicious scripts from running in the application.
We use the django-csp middleware to enforce a strict CSP policy.

‚úÖ Installed Django CSP Middleware

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install django-csp
‚úÖ Configured settings.py

python
Copy
Edit
INSTALLED_APPS += ['csp']

MIDDLEWARE += ['csp.middleware.CSPMiddleware']

CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'self'",)  # Allow scripts only from this domain
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'",)  # Restrict inline scripts
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'", "'unsafe-inline'")  # Allow inline styles
5. Input Validation and Sanitization
We validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
‚úÖ Example: Preventing XSS in Form Input Validation

python
Copy
Edit
from django import forms
from .models import Book

class BookForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['title', 'author']
    
    def clean_title(self):
        title = self.cleaned_data['title']
        if "<script>" in title:  # Prevent XSS injection
            raise forms.ValidationError("Invalid title")
        return title
6. Security Testing
We performed the following manual tests to confirm the security settings:

‚úÖ CSRF Protection:

Attempted a form submission without a CSRF token ‚Üí Request was rejected ‚úÖ
‚úÖ XSS Protection:

Tried injecting <script>alert("XSS")</script> into form fields ‚Üí Script was blocked ‚úÖ
‚úÖ SQL Injection Protection:

Tested input ' OR 1=1; -- ‚Üí Database query remained secure ‚úÖ
7. Future Security Enhancements
Implement Django‚Äôs SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True to force HTTPS in production.
Use django-axes or rate-limiting middleware to prevent brute-force attacks.
Implement Django‚Äôs password validation policies for stronger authentication security.
üìå Conclusion
With these security implementations, LibraryProject is protected against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection. Regular audits and testing will ensure ongoing security improvements.
